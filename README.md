# Lantern version of 'Empirical Methods in Political Science' by Jean Clipperton

This text was created through Northwestern's OER Faculty Grant Program (2019). In 2020, Chris Diaz and Lauren McKeen McDonald received a grant through the Association of Research Libraries' Venture Fund to create an OER toolkit that teaches minimal computing practices, including a template and workflow for production. The outcome of the grant project is called [Lantern](https://github.com/nulib-oer/lantern). This repository was created by Chris Diaz with Lantern, and the generated website is a working example of Lantern's capabilities. As it is just an example text, it is not being updated or maintained by Northwestern University Libraries a this time.

The original source text for this book can be found at https://github.com/nulib-oer/empirical-methods-polisci, and the public website, which is currently being used in Northwestern's Political Science 210 course can be accessed here: https://nulib-oer.github.io/empirical-methods-polisci/
